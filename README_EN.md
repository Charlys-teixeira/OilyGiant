# 🛢️ OilyGiant – Oil Wells Selection

## 📖 Description

This project aims to help OilyGiant identify the most profitable regions for oil well drilling. The analysis includes forecasting extraction volumes and calculating financial risk to support strategic investment decisions.  

## 🎯 Goals

- Analyze data from three prospecting regions.  
- Build regression models to predict well production.  
- Evaluate expected profitability and risks using bootstrapping.  
- Select the most promising region for investment.  

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 📌 Methodology

- Data preprocessing and scaling using StandardScaler.  
- Linear Regression training for each region.  
- Profit calculation considering fixed costs and well limits.  
- Risk and confidence assessment using 1,000 bootstrap samples.  

## 📈 Results

Region X showed the highest expected profit and lowest risk of loss. Probability of losses below 2.5% in the chosen region. The model supports safe decisions to maximize profits.
